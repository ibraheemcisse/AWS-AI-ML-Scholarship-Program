## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

```python
class EnhancedChatbot:
    ├── Context Management
    │   ├── conversation_history[]
    │   ├── user_context{}
    │   └── session_tracking
    │
    ├── NLP Engine
    │   ├── extract_entities()
    │   ├── analyze_sentiment()
    │   └── find_best_response()
    │
    ├── Response System
    │   ├── categorized_responses{}
    │   ├── personalize_response()
    │   └── escalation_logic
    │
    └── Intelligence Layer
        ├── confidence_scoring
        ├── pattern_matching
        └── fallback_handling
```

## 🎯 Key Capabilities

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
```python
def analyze_sentiment(self, user_input: str) -> str:
    positive_words = ['great', 'good', 'excellent', 'amazing', 'love']
    negative_words = ['bad', 'terrible', 'awful', 'hate', 'horrible']
    # Returns: 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'
```

### 2. Entity Recognition
- **Order Numbers**: Detects patterns like `TG-12345678`
- **Product Categories**: Identifies mentions of products
- **User Intent**: Categorizes requests automatically

### 3. Smart Escalation
```python
def should_escalate(self, user_input: str) -> bool:
    # Escalates when:
    # - User requests human support
    # - Multiple negative sentiment messages
    # - Complex issues detected
```

## 📊 Response Categories
